### Say hi to Snoop!

This is not a very useful chat application.. But hey, who doesn't want to chat with a virtual dog named Snoop?

_Hint! He loves greetings_. 

### If I had more time I would:

1. Improve the Snoop vocabulary / logic
2. Use SASS
3. Improve the Proximity component
4. Build an inbox
